##introduce myself

Hi,everybody.
Let me introduce myself ? My name is Pei-shan Li.
I am from Taipei, Taiwan.
I am studying English.
I am now twenty-four years old.
I was born in 1994.
At present I am studying at the National Taipei University of Business (NTUB) , majoring in Information Management.
I like many things, especially music and reading.
I think I'm somewhat on the shy side.
I hope I will have the chance to develop my interests and capability in this course.
